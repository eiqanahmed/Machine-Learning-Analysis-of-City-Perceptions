# Shop Search Package

This package facilitates making asynchronous requests to multiple shopping sites to execute a search query.

## Important Note

**Do not use this code to persist user information.** Make sure to thoroughly review the API documentation for eBay, Kroger, and BestBuy to understand all permitted use cases.

## API Keys

If you helped develop this project, you should have received a JSON file (api_keys.json) containing the API keys (client secret). You need this JSON file to utilize this package.

### Usage Instructions:

1. Place the JSON file containing the API keys inside the `shop_search` directory. Ensure that the JSON file is on the same level as the migrations folder.
