This file describes important info in case the app was to go into production:

1) To save products in our database, we have to sign up for eBay's notification system.

2) BestBuy's API doesn't permit persistent storage of its data, it can only be stored temporarily

3) (Future) Etsy's API will likely be non-commercial until we have a valid url.
